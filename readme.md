# Codebar-APIcall

A starting point for making calls from a website to an API.

A student at Codebar is building a UI for an API they've created using [Strapi](https://strapi.io/). This repo will give some demo code and tips for further investigation - it isn't designed to be fit for purpose or perfect :)

## Useful tools

[http-server: a command-line http server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) to run the UI code
