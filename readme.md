# Codebar-APIcall

A starting point for making API calls from UI JavaScript.

Anyone is welcome to poke around but caveat emptor! This repo is tailored to support a student I met at Codebar and reflects our discussions about how they might continue developing their UI against their API created using [Strapi](https://strapi.io/). The idea is to give clues for their next steps, not to provide exemplar code.

## Useful tools & tips

I like the npm package [http-server: a command-line http server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) when I want a no-faff server to run my web code.

Disable cache when devtools is open! Always catches me out - the browser will cache the file so your changes aren't loaded when you refresh :D In Firefox, open devtools then devtools settings & check the box under Advanced settings for "Disable HTTP cache (when toolbox is open)".
